Introduction
Traffic sign recognition is a crucial task in the field of autonomous driving. This notebook provides an implementation of traffic sign classification using sequential models built in TensorFlow and PyTorch. The goal is to classify images of traffic signs into their respective categories.

Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). It contains images of traffic signs belonging to 43 different classes.

Setup and Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

TensorFlow
PyTorch
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow torch numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Model Architecture
TensorFlow Sequential Model
The TensorFlow model is built using the Sequential API. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and fully connected layers for classification.

PyTorch Sequential Model
The PyTorch model is built using the torch.nn.Sequential module. It also consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout, and fully connected layers similar to the TensorFlow model.

Training the Model
The notebook includes code for training both the TensorFlow and PyTorch models. The training process involves:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
Defining the model architecture.
Compiling the model (for TensorFlow).
Training the model on the training data.
Monitoring the training process using validation data.
Evaluation
After training, the models are evaluated on the test dataset. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Usage
To use this notebook, simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells in order. Make sure you have installed all the required dependencies.

Results
The results section of the notebook shows the performance of the models on the test dataset. It includes visualizations of the training process, accuracy, and loss curves, as well as the confusion matrix and classification report for detailed performance analysis.
